## Abstract

We identify and formally name a structural constraint that has been partially recognized across multiple disciplines but never unified: the *Pre-Articulation Observability Boundary*. This boundary describes the irreversible information loss when pre-linguistic cognition becomes language, and the consequent permanent exclusion of language-based AI systems from the cognitive states that precede articulation.

Unlike capability gaps addressable through scale or training, this boundary is architectural—it arises from the nature of language itself as a lossy compression of experience.

## Key Contributions

1. **Identification**: Demonstrates that this constraint sits at the intersection of multiple disciplines, each naming adjacent concepts without capturing the whole

2. **Formalization**: Proposes precise terminology grounded in control theory, psycholinguistics, and safety engineering

3. **Asymmetry Analysis**: Explains why humans survive the boundary while AI systems violate it, identifying *commitment without closure* as the structural difference

4. **Design Implications**: Derives mandates that follow from treating this as a boundary to be respected rather than a problem to be solved
